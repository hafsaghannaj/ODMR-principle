# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving this resource. Contributions that enhance scientific accuracy, reproducibility, or visual clarity are welcome.

## Scope

This repository maintains publication-ready diagrams for ODMR and NV-center physics. Contributions should fall within one of the following categories:

- **New figures** — Additional diagrams covering NV physics topics not yet represented (e.g., Ramsey interferometry, Hahn echo, pulsed ODMR sequences, widefield imaging).
- **Corrections** — Fixes to physical parameters, equations, labels, or descriptions.
- **Reproducibility improvements** — Better dependency pinning, CI pipelines, or cross-platform compatibility.
- **Documentation** — Expanded theory notes, experimental protocols, or usage examples.

## Standards

### Scientific accuracy

All physical parameters, equations, and descriptions must be traceable to peer-reviewed sources. When adding or modifying scientific content, include a reference in your pull request description.

### Figure quality

- Python figures must be generated by `generate_figures.py` with deterministic output (use fixed random seeds where applicable).
- TikZ figures must compile with a standard TeX Live distribution.
- All figures should be saved in PNG (300 DPI), SVG, and PDF formats.
- Use the existing matplotlib style settings defined at the top of `generate_figures.py`.

### Code style

- Python code should be readable and well-documented.
- Physical constants and parameters should be defined as named variables, not magic numbers.
- Follow the existing project structure: scripts in `scripts/`, outputs in `diagrams/`, documentation in `docs/`.

## Process

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `add-ramsey-fringe-figure`).
3. Make your changes, ensuring all figures regenerate correctly.
4. Open a pull request with:
   - A clear description of what was added or changed.
   - References for any new scientific content.
   - Confirmation that `python generate_figures.py` runs without errors.

## What we will not merge

- Changes that alter scientific meaning without justification.
- Figures that require manual post-processing to reproduce.
- Marketing language, decorative additions, or content unrelated to ODMR/NV physics.
- Dependencies on proprietary or non-standard tools without a clear rationale.

## Questions

If you are unsure whether a contribution is in scope, open an issue to discuss before investing effort.
